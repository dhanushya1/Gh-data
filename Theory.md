## Activity types 

- the exact type of event that should trigger a workflow 
- open/closing a pull request 
- but pr from forked repo
  - need initial approval from owner to run the worflow 

- can cancel and skip workflows 
  - skip
    - add [npm ci] or so in commit message

## Event filters 

- can add filters to avoid some execution 
- push to a specific branch 
  - path-ignore:
    on:
        push:
            paths-ignore:
                - 'docs/**'
  - A workflow with the following path filter 
  will only run on push events that 
  include at least one file outside the docs 
  directory at the root of the repository.


## Job Artifacts 

- output assets (generated by a job)
  - can download manually 
  - download automatically in another job 

## Job outputs 

- simple value that we wanna maybe use in next job or so 
- could be name of a file 


## Dependency caching 

- all jobs need the same dependencies to be installed 
- so, we can cache these dependencies, so that worflow time is reduced
